# YT_Analysis
A project I started and never finished.\
Analyses several different things about YT videos:\
1) Retrieves the most watched videos in the "most popular" category for the past 24 hours and extracts title, link, viewCount, likeCount, and commentCount of each video
2) Retrieves a bunch of data from the top 10 videos
3) Detects the number of faces in each video thumbnail and draws a triangle around each of them
4) NLP sentiment analysis on the comment sections
5) Bulding a ML model to predict dislikes
6) Coorelating different aspects of the videos (dislikes, views per like, tag sentiment, comment section sentiment, etc...)
7) Produce a heatmap, scatterplots, and p-values for correlations
8) Linear, ridge, lasso, elastic net regressions and model evaluations

Generally the code is super slopy and doesn't really have any one goal. It was just a scipt I put several hours into and kinda lost the motivation to keep working on.
